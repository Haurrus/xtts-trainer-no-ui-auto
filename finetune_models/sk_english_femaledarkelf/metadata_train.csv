wavs/voiceline_2.wav|The Voice? Here?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_3.wav|That sound could bring mountains down!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_4.wav|What was that?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_6.wav|Do your worst!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_11.wav|Filthy fetcher!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_16.wav|That the best you can do?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_18.wav|Hands off.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_19.wav|Watch what you're doing.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_20.wav|Don't even think about it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_29.wav|Mercy!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_30.wav|No more! I yield! I yield!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_31.wav|Enough!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_32.wav|Damn you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_33.wav|Ha! Like the bite of a flea!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_34.wav|Just a... scratch!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_35.wav|Gods, no!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_36.wav|Walk always in shadows, so that you will see your foes before they see you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_37.wav|You seem to be a little short on coin. Come back and see me when you've got the gold.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_38.wav|You have chosen wisely. Lead on, and I shall follow.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_39.wav|Stay back, lord!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_40.wav|Halt in the name of the Jarl Balgruuf the Greater!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_41.wav|May your will carve itself upon the world.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_42.wav|That can be arranged.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_43.wav|I don't think so!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_44.wav|They're fighting over that thing, I think.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_45.wav|What's all the commotion?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_46.wav|Hey! That's my sword.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_47.wav|Don't touch that dagger! It's mine.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_48.wav|I don't think so. That axe is mine.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_49.wav|Keep away from that bow. It's mine.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_50.wav|Hands off. That's my armor now!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_51.wav|You're too slow. I saw it first.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_52.wav|Someone's going to get hurt.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_53.wav|Good enough.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_54.wav|Just getting jumpy I guess.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_55.wav|Must have been nothing.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_56.wav|Come on!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_57.wav|I knew I'd find you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_58.wav|Cleared out, I guess.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_59.wav|Anybody there?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_60.wav|What do you need, guardian?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_61.wav|Yes, champion of Azura?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_62.wav|The Twilight watches us all, guardian.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_63.wav|Oh, I don't believe those rumors, my friend.  Besides, who would ever want to harm such beauty?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_64.wav|Halt in the name of the Jarl Hrongar.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_67.wav|There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_68.wav|We're one of the same kind, you and I. I'm glad to have met you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_69.wav|I'm not going to warn you again.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_70.wav|Once more and I'm going to have to kill you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_71.wav|Don't do that again. Last warning.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_72.wav|You're pushing your luck.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_73.wav|What's the matter with you?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_74.wav|Stop that.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_75.wav|Watch it!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_76.wav|Hey, be careful!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_77.wav|What are you doing?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_78.wav|You dirty thief!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_79.wav|Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_80.wav|Do not fight it. Azura's prophecies always come to pass. To deny them is to go headlong into the darkness with no light to guide you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_81.wav|Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_82.wav|But I refuse to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_83.wav|My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_84.wav|Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_85.wav|This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget that she watches over us all.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_86.wav|We are children of the Twilight. Beings who are to be guided from the darkness into the light. And from the light into darkness.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_87.wav|Azura. Who led her children away from the disaster of Vvardenfell. You are the prophet that reveals our true future.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_88.wav|No harm shall come to me, for I live under Azura's wisdom. Her foresight protects me. Her insight sustains me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_89.wav|Protect the Jarl with your lives!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_90.wav|Leave that dog alone!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_91.wav|Hey, that's a valuable animal!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_92.wav|There is an unnatural chill in the air. Some evil power is at work in this place.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_93.wav|I do not envy those creatures that make a home in such cold, dark places as this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_94.wav|Careful. Our footsteps will echo in every chamber and tunnel.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_95.wav|In a mine, the poor man labors to find precious stones that only the rich man can afford.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_96.wav|I wonder how many poor souls have lost their lives working these tunnels.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_97.wav|These earthen passages do not agree with me. I already miss the wind and sky.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_98.wav|The fewer of these mines we venture into, the happier I'll be.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_99.wav|It is strange to think that these chambers were once home to the ancient Nords.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_100.wav|Yes, yes I did. I've already sent instructions, you just need to make sure this arrives in one piece.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_101.wav|My wife died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_102.wav|My husband died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_103.wav|My father died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_104.wav|My mother died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_105.wav|My daughter died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_106.wav|My son died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_107.wav|My sister died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_108.wav|My brother died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_109.wav|My aunt died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_110.wav|My uncle died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_111.wav|My niece died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_112.wav|My nephew died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_113.wav|My cousin died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_114.wav|My cousin died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_115.wav|My kinsman died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_116.wav|My kinswoman died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_117.wav|My friend died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_118.wav|My friend died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_119.wav|My girlfriend died. Things won't be the same without her.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_120.wav|My boyfriend died. Things won't be the same without him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_121.wav|Azura has seen your coming, traveler. It was not curiosity, but fate, that has led you here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_122.wav|Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_123.wav|You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_124.wav|Help! Someone's being attacked!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_125.wav|Help! I'm being attacked!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_126.wav|Last mistake.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_127.wav|Hey! Hands off!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_128.wav|Hey, that isn't yours!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_129.wav|Help! Murder!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_130.wav|Murdered! In cold blood!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_131.wav|By the gods, no!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_132.wav|Why you...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_133.wav|Pickpocket! We've got a pickpocket!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_134.wav|You should have listened. Guards! Help! Trespasser!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_135.wav|I'm not going to warn you again. Get out, or I'll call the guards!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_136.wav|It's time for you to leave, my friend.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_137.wav|You, of all people. Get out!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_138.wav|Can't a woman get a moment to herself? Leave me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_139.wav|Azura's Star! I knew the Lady of Twilight had sent you for a reason.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_140.wav|Hand it over to me. I will ask Azura to restore the Star to its original purity.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_141.wav|Exile or no, my duty to Balgruuf remains. Keep that in mind when you approach him, for I will be watching.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_142.wav|It seems our enemies have no end of spies, saboteurs and assassins to send against us.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_143.wav|Make a move toward Balgruuf, and you're dead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_144.wav|She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_149.wav|An outsider? No reason to stop in Kynesgrove. Keep moving.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_150.wav|The mine's always on the verge of collapse. Good thing I'm around to keep it up.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_151.wav|Morrowind used to be a lovely place, but you couldn't pay me to live there these days.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_152.wav|Most people in Skyrim don't care for Dunmer. Rwavi's the only one around here even half-decent.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_153.wav|I should get over to Windhelm more. See how the other Morrowind refugees are getting along.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_154.wav|Dravin! One of the soldiers I spoke to on the way home said you threatened them. What's come over you?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_155.wav|All you'll accomplish by threatening them is ending up in the Riften dungeon. You're lucky they didn't take you seriously.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_156.wav|I don't care! Just stay away from the soldiers and keep to your business. It's the only way we'll make it through this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_157.wav|If it puts your mind at ease, I'll take it with me. I'm sorry.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_158.wav|Now that you've brought Dravin's bow back, he's back to his crabby old self. For better or for worse, I still thank you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_159.wav|You'll have to forgive my husband's manners. He's not used to pleasantries.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_160.wav|The war's been hard on the farm and hard on Dravin. We don't know what to expect from one day to the next.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_161.wav|Someday, I hope we can get away from here... perhaps move back to Morrowind. This isn't at all what we expected.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_162.wav|Husband, you worry far too much. We are within an hour's walk of Riften.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_163.wav|I'm going to find whoever did this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_164.wav|Oh... what happened?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_165.wav|I feel the eyes of angry spirits upon us. We are not welcome here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_166.wav|Few would dare to trespass in these ruins. What you lack in wisdom, you make up for in courage.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_192.wav|What kind of filthy barbarian just throws their trash on the ground?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_193.wav|Are you out of your mind?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_194.wav|If you value your well being, you will offer an apology...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_195.wav|You should be.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_196.wav|What is that half-naked fetcher trying to prove?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_197.wav|Looks dead to me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_198.wav|I don't want any trouble. Not after what you did to me last time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_199.wav|No... not like this...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_200.wav|Please... mercy...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_201.wav|I guess you had your reasons.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_202.wav|Was that really necessary?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_203.wav|If I can just... stand up...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_204.wav|I guess I can look the other way, this time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_205.wav|Oh, what a clever thief you are.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_206.wav|I'll let you stay. This time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_207.wav|Guess they deserved it...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_208.wav|I didn't know you were so cold-blooded...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_209.wav|Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, and you're going to leave me alone. Deal?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_210.wav|Look, Ambarys, I just came here for a drink. I don't need any trouble.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_211.wav|What do you want from me? I work for them ok? We're not friends. They pay me, and I get the job done. That's it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_212.wav|Either pour another drink or keep moving, Ambarys.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_213.wav|Gods! Another fight.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_217.wav|There may be no enemy more foul than a walking corpse.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_218.wav|These ruins and their mechanical inhabitants are all that remain of the Dwemer.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_219.wav|It's said that the Forsworn make dark pacts with the Hagravens, and that is why they can use magic.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_220.wav|There is no adversary more deadly than a vampire. They are as cruel as they are cunning.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_223.wav|What's the hurry?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_224.wav|I'll let you live. This time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_225.wav|I don't have to take this from the likes of you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_226.wav|Hey, don't look at me that way! Who are you to judge me?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_227.wav|So what if I have a problem? I know how to deal with it!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_228.wav|Maramal thinks he's so smart; tells me that Mara will cleanse the filth from my blood. Ha! What does he know?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_229.wav|If Indaryn finds out, he'll have me thrown out of the Meadery for certain. So don't breathe a word of it to him. Not a word!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_230.wav|Oh what am I going do? I can barely afford to stay at the Bunkhouse.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_231.wav|"My n'wah of a father thought he could pull my strings... """"continue the Hlaalu tradition."""" Bah! I left all that nonsense behind."|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_232.wav|I'm going to stop. That's what I'm going to do! Then everyone will see that I'm not as useless as they think.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_233.wav|I'll see you burn!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_239.wav|Do you know what Indaryn told me? He said if I'm late one more time he'll kick me right out the door!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_240.wav|What do you mean?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_248.wav|Thank you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_262.wav|This what you want? Huh?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_263.wav|Not quite good enough, are you?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_264.wav|Give up while you still can!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_265.wav|Nerevar guide me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_266.wav|Until next time, guardian.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_267.wav|It's been an honor, guardian.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_268.wav|I was a sorceress of no small skill before I came into Azura's faith. Afterwards, her magic sustained me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_269.wav|I could easily provide my spells to your cause. Protect you from harm. Defeat your enemies.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_270.wav|Twilight watch over you, guardian.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_271.wav|Are you ready for me to show Azura her Star and receive her wisdom?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_272.wav|While you were in the Star, Azura gave me a vision. Her last, she said.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_273.wav|I have never been without Azura's foresight since escaping Morrowind. I don't know what to do.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_274.wav|If you need me, I'd be honored to accompany you, Guardian of the Star. It would give me a purpose.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_275.wav|Leave this shrine, blasphemer, before I kill you for defiling Azura's artifact.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_276.wav|She wishes to speak to you herself. Please. Place your hands on the altar, and you will hear her voice.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_277.wav|Azura. Mother of Roses. Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. Your chosen champion has returned your Star to you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_278.wav|No. She said my part was over. That my fate had moved beyond the Twilight, and I was on my own.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_279.wav|I will tend Azura's shrine when you do not need me. I still have my duties, but for the first time I feel... alone.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_280.wav|Then you are weak and inconsequential.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_281.wav|You are nothing.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_282.wav|Shhh! Be still. Beware her anger!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_283.wav|Our Lord! She has come!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_285.wav|Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end of time - it is for naught.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_286.wav|Names mean nothing to our Lord. She only cares for those who care for themselves, whose hearts are full of purpose, whose lives are full of deeds.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_287.wav|We are forged by Boethiah's example. We carve our will upon the world through our tongues and our blades.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_288.wav|You? You are nothing. An empty vapor, dispersed by the slightest breeze.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_289.wav|A well placed word, or a well placed dagger. Both can achieve equal purposes.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_290.wav|Though we live in shadow, we carve indelible signs of our passing into the world.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_291.wav|We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_292.wav|Good. Perhaps I've misjudged.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_293.wav|If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_294.wav|First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_295.wav|Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_296.wav|If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_297.wav|Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_298.wav|That remains to be seen. But if it is so, and if Boethiah appears, then we will welcome you as one of us.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_299.wav|It's really dead, then?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_300.wav|I never would have believed it, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_301.wav|It may be dead now, but... where did it come from?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_302.wav|In all my years, I've never seen such a thing...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_303.wav|Something's happening...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_304.wav|What manner of magic is this?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_305.wav|Look out! Don't get too close!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_306.wav|It's like the ancient legends. Dragonborn...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_307.wav|It can't be... You... You took its very soul...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_308.wav|By the gods... I don't even know what to say...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_309.wav|Mara only helps those who can afford her tithes. This is nonsense.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_310.wav|Let me know if you see anything you like.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_311.wav|Keep your distance...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_312.wav|Good dog.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_313.wav|Stupid dog.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_314.wav|A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_315.wav|Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_316.wav|That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_317.wav|But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_318.wav|You heard right! I said a dragon!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_319.wav|Here's the situation.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_320.wav|I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_321.wav|You're the one that got out of Helgen, aren't you? I could use anyone who's tangled with a dragon before.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_322.wav|Where do you think you'll be the most help - scouting ahead or supporting the rest of my men?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_323.wav|Well? You going to scout ahead or travel with me?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_324.wav|Jarl Balgruuf is waiting.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_325.wav|Good enough. We'll meet up near the watchtower. Don't take any chances until we get there.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_326.wav|That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_327.wav|I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_328.wav|You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_329.wav|I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_330.wav|We'd better go make sure that bastard is really dead. Collect us a trophy or something to bring back to Ulfric.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_331.wav|Scatter and get behind cover! We need to hurt it, somehow! If you've got a bow or spells, now would be a good time to use them!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_332.wav|I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_333.wav|Well, if the shoe fits...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_334.wav|Can't tell you. It's a bit of a trade secret I picked up when I was living in High Rock.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_335.wav|What rumors?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_336.wav|I heard a traveler say that Helgen was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_337.wav|May I ask what all the honey's for? I mean, you used to buy almost a jar a week. Are you cooking or something?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_338.wav|Yes?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_339.wav|I'm afraid it's going to be a while before I can get any more Goldenglow Honey.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_340.wav|Oh! Miss Maven. What can I do for you?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_341.wav|Do you wish to test yourself against me?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_342.wav|If you wish to gain Boethiah's attention, you must slay a thrall upon her shrine.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_343.wav|You were weak. Now you are dead. What signs have you left of your passing for us to remember you by?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_344.wav|Sounds good. May I owe you for them?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_345.wav|Shadr, that's so sweet... I'd love to.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_346.wav|There's someone I like very much in Riften. I think I'd like to marry him someday, but... well, he's not of my kind. Would Mara be angry?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_347.wav|I'm well. How are things over at the stables? Old Hofgrir giving you a hard time?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_348.wav|Dinya? I was reading that missive you gave me and I was wondering something about marriage.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_349.wav|You know I can't tell you that. As soon as I do, and you have a few meads in you, everyone will know.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_350.wav|I've heard. Bolli and Keerava were speaking of it just a little while ago.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_351.wav|I told you everything I know. What else did you want?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_352.wav|You looking for something?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_353.wav|I think I've said enough. Now leave me alone.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_354.wav|Congratulations on your wedding. I'm so happy for both of you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_355.wav|Just leave.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_356.wav|Well, well, you actually did what you said you were going to do. I'm impressed.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_357.wav|Here, let me teach you a thing or two about Alteration magic. It's the least I can do.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_358.wav|It's not any of your bother, so I don't see what you're apologizing for.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_359.wav|If you want to go to the trouble, feel free. I suppose I could offer you a bit of free Alteration training when you get back.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_360.wav|Nosy one, huh? I was a mage back in Morrowind. I lend my talents to the mines here, helping them keep the tunnels safe.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_361.wav|By Azura, it gets hot in there. I use Frost Salts for a potion to keep the heat bearable, but I'm out.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_362.wav|What are you doing that for?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_363.wav|You need to leave.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_367.wav|Well... if you say so.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_368.wav|Well, this is a nice mess you've gotten me into.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_369.wav|That could have turned out better.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_370.wav|I can't believe I got caught.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_371.wav|After we were robbed, Dravin's become more bitter than ever. He hates this place.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_372.wav|If that weapon breaks anything, you will be buying it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_373.wav|You'd better know how to use that weapon if you plan on swinging it around in here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_374.wav|I knew it!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_375.wav|Hello? Who's there?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_376.wav|Is someone there?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_377.wav|What was that?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_379.wav|Where are you?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_380.wav|You can't hide from me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_381.wav|Be careful!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_382.wav|Hey, watch it!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_383.wav|Don't do that.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_384.wav|Keep your hands to yourself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_385.wav|There you are!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_386.wav|Mind's playing tricks on me...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_389.wav|How did you do that?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_390.wav|Over here!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_391.wav|You could have just asked.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_392.wav|I saw you do that, you know.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_393.wav|Ha! Found you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_394.wav|Get him!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_395.wav|The mill!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_396.wav|The flour mill!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_397.wav|The smelter!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_398.wav|Somebody do something!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_399.wav|Hurry!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_400.wav|What's all the commotion?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_401.wav|By the gods!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_402.wav|What in the world...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_403.wav|This can't be happening.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_404.wav|I know I heard something.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_430.wav|What did I tell you about snooping around my wards?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_431.wav|Again? But there shouldn't be any earthstreams over there. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_432.wav|No, I've been busy trying to keep the whole mine from collapsing, if that's all right with you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_433.wav|Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_434.wav|And if you don't let me secure the steam channel, your leg could get blown off.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_435.wav|So go dig at the other corner for a bit.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_436.wav|All right, I'll take a look at it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_437.wav|Nothing I can't handle.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_438.wav|Just what you see here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_439.wav|Spells and incantations for those with the talent to cast them.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_440.wav|Time to... finish this!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_441.wav|I'm going to... put you down!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_442.wav|Never should have come here...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_443.wav|You'll be so much easier to rob when you're dead...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_444.wav|You cannot even conceive of the power I wield...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_445.wav|All right, then.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_447.wav|Lookee here. Looks like we got ourselves a hero.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_448.wav|You picked a bad time to get lost, friend.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_449.wav|Now ain't this a surprise.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_450.wav|Ugh! That it? That your best?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_451.wav|Agh! Flithy n'wah!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_452.wav|I can certainly share a bit of what I know.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_453.wav|Safe travels.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_454.wav|Until next time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_455.wav|Yes?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_456.wav|Need something?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_457.wav|I'm on your side!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_458.wav|You're not supposed to be in here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_459.wav|Hmm. Yes, it is quite sad. A young boy, Aventus Aretino, lost his mother recently, and was sent to an orphanage.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_460.wav|But he has returned home, and people have heard strange chanting. They say it's the Black Sacrament, the ritual to contact the Dark Brotherhood.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_461.wav|Why a little boy would want to contact a group of murderers is beyond me, but he is inviting evil into this city.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_462.wav|Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_463.wav|All right. I won't deny it, child. What you heard is true. But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_464.wav|No, child! Wait! That boy, that house - they're cursed.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_465.wav|I try to keep Grimvar safe, but these are dangerous times.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_466.wav|Now. Enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_467.wav|You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_468.wav|Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_469.wav|It is cryptic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_470.wav|Not here. Definitely not here. You want to learn, join the College in Winterhold. They'll deal with it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_471.wav|I've got my eyes on you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_472.wav|Mind yourself in front of the Jarl, or we'll have serious problems.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_473.wav|You could have asked before just taking it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_474.wav|There is no one else, but very well. I cannot force you to accept your destiny.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_475.wav|Good. All will be revealed in time. Keep playing your part, and Azura will reward you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_476.wav|I will commune with Azura.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_477.wav|Please place your hands on the altar. Azura wishes to speak with you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_478.wav|I am charged with protecting the Jarl from any and all threats.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_479.wav|Powerful men have many enemies. More so, in times of strife. So you can imagine the dangers.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_480.wav|Oh yes, there have been attempts on the Jarl's life. More than one would-be assassin has met his end at the tip of my blade.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_481.wav|Balgruuf and I share a battle bond. We met as youths, and forged our friendship in the fires of war.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_482.wav|When he became Jarl, I insisted on serving as his protector. He had no cause to argue.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_483.wav|Gods, you are curious. Almost... dangerously so.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_484.wav|Take your pick. Dragons, Stormcloak assassins, ambitious and unscrupulous nobles... Sometimes I think his own children want him dead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_485.wav|And those are just the physical threats. Assaults on his sanity are another matter entirely.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_486.wav|Every day, he deals with obsequious functionaries and incompetent bureaucrats. Sadly, I'm not allowed to eliminate them.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_487.wav|Well, not yet, anyway.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_488.wav|Azura is watching over you. She has seen this before it ever happened.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_489.wav|All will happen as it has been foretold.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_490.wav|The Twilight has foreseen all of this. Everything will be revealed in time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_491.wav|Twilight guide your path.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_492.wav|May Azura's magic protect you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_493.wav|This has all been foreseen, and we must play our parts.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_494.wav|You reek. A little friendly advice - take a bath and get some new clothes.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_495.wav|Whatever you're about to say, don't bother. I don't want to hear it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_496.wav|What hole did you crawl out of?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_497.wav|Out of my way, or I'll cut you. Deep.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_498.wav|No!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_499.wav|That's... all you've got?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_500.wav|That your best? Huh?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_501.wav|It's... nothing...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_504.wav|Close...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_505.wav|You'll need to do better than that.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_506.wav|Easily blocked!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_507.wav|Oho! Not so fast!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_508.wav|Die already so I can take your stuff!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_509.wav|Whatcha gonna do? Huh? Whatcha gonna do?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_510.wav|Gonna split your belly like an old woman's purse!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_511.wav|Gonna rip you... open!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_512.wav|Tell you what. You start running so I can stab you in the back.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_513.wav|Can't wait to count out your coin...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_514.wav|Fire, frost, or lightning - you will suffer at my hands!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_515.wav|Don't you see? I am master of the arcane!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_516.wav|Come on! Come on!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_517.wav|I'll have your head!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_518.wav|Die, damn you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_519.wav|I'll... Kill you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_520.wav|Just... stand still!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_521.wav|Gods... damn you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_522.wav|Just... die!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_523.wav|Enough... of this!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_524.wav|I've had enough of you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_525.wav|This what you want?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_526.wav|Ha! I think you're bleeding!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_527.wav|Weren't expecting that, were you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_528.wav|Not impressed!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_529.wav|You're nothing!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_530.wav|Going to cry now? Huh?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_531.wav|I'll try and make this quick!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_532.wav|You'd better speak to the Jarl, then.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_533.wav|Now that's how it's done! I doubt anyone in Skyrim could have weaved a better enchantment.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_534.wav|Watching you reminds me of my first days as an enchanter.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_569.wav|That's a dangerous game you're playing.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_648.wav|Take a good look around. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. If not, let me know, I might have it stored away.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_649.wav|Got something for just about everybody in here. Give a holler if you have any questions.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_650.wav|Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_651.wav|Hello friend. Make yourself at home.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_652.wav|You lost?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_653.wav|I trust you're not planning any trouble. What can I do for you, friend?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_654.wav|I'm not going out there. Not with that dragon on the loose.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_655.wav|I wouldn't go out there for all the money in the world.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_656.wav|Do you think it's gone yet?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_657.wav|We've got to find someplace to hide!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_658.wav|Don't you know there's a dragon attacking?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_659.wav|Sir...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_660.wav|I am an artisan, painting in strokes of blood red upon the canvas of life. But yes, I will take coin to fight at your side.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_661.wav|After all, where is the value in creating art if there is nobody left alive to see it?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_662.wav|Good to see you. Come on in.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_663.wav|Who would have thought I would be getting married?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_664.wav|Get out of my sight.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_665.wav|I'll see you there.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_666.wav|I'll be here, my dear.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_667.wav|A good house. You chose well. I don't like sitting still, so I've decided to open a store. Buy and sell whatever is needed.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_668.wav|Good to see you, dear.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_669.wav|Yes, love?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_670.wav|Everyone, on me! The Jarl wishes to speak!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_671.wav|I can. Here. This is fresh. I'll have another one made tomorrow.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_672.wav|I'll be waiting for you at home, then.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_673.wav|And where would that be?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_674.wav|Married. It doesn't feel like I thought it would, but I'm happy. Where should we live? You could stay with me....|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_675.wav|I thought about becoming a bandit. I decided I preferred clean clothes and fresh mead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_676.wav|Don't get too far ahead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_677.wav|What do you want? There's no words left to say to each other.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_678.wav|Leave. Now!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_679.wav|All right, we'll start again, but watch yourself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_680.wav|An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_681.wav|You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_682.wav|The wedding is soon. It'll be a good day.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_683.wav|But we haven't taken a side because it's not our fight.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_684.wav|Imperial spies? You can't be serious!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_685.wav|Then it's settled. You and me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_686.wav|Your choice.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_687.wav|Won't lie, I am. And you?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_688.wav|Murdered? By Azura, who would do such a thing?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_689.wav|Nothing new there. Most of the Nords living in Windhelm don't care much for us, but Rolff is the worst by far.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_690.wav|He likes to get drunk and walk around the Gray Quarter yelling insults at us in the small hours of the morning. A real charmer, that one.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_691.wav|I'm staying out of this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_692.wav|It has. Here, this is your half, love.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_693.wav|Back off!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_694.wav|If nobody wants that, I'll take it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_695.wav|Damn. That's quite a sight.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_696.wav|Trouble is in the air here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_697.wav|Hmm. Caves. Wonder what's below.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_698.wav|Nordic ruins. Old. Secretive.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_699.wav|Dwemer ruins. The people under the mountains. All gone now.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_700.wav|Release...me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_702.wav|You're getting pretty good at this dragon-fighting business.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_703.wav|I don't know how you talked the Jarl into this plan of yours.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_704.wav|My job is to keep the Jarl safe, despite his best efforts.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_705.wav|Remind me not to make you angry.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_706.wav|You can stay, but you're not supposed to be here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_707.wav|Stay away from that.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_708.wav|It's locked for a reason.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_709.wav|Someone do something!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_710.wav|Help me, help me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_711.wav|Think you can steal from me?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_712.wav|Oh no you don't!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_713.wav|You little thief!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_714.wav|Filthy pickpocket!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_715.wav|You're not getting anything from me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_716.wav|How dare you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_717.wav|I'm starting to think...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_718.wav|Whatever you have to say to the Jarl, you can say to me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_719.wav|You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Approach.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_720.wav|As housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that threaten the Jarl or his people. So you have my attention. Now, explain yourself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_721.wav|Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_722.wav|What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruuf is not receiving visitors.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_723.wav|You are a welcome guest, but you must still respect the rules of the Jarl's household.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_724.wav|We can never rest easy, for Balgruuf's enemies will not.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_725.wav|Please keep your weapons sheathed in the Jarl's presence.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_726.wav|Think very carefully about your next move...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_727.wav|What the...?!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_728.wav|Someone do something!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_729.wav|Die, you filthy beast!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_730.wav|Die, beast!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_731.wav|Get away from me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_732.wav|I saw you steal that!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_733.wav|You thieving little elf!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_734.wav|Why are you doing that?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_735.wav|What are you doing, s'wit?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_736.wav|Help, someone!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_737.wav|It's in the most immediate danger, if that dragon is lurking in the mountains...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_738.wav|My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_739.wav|Yes, my Jarl.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_740.wav|Your main job will be to keep an eye out and get the people to safety if the town is attacked.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_741.wav|I can't afford to send anyone else. And we don't know where the dragon is. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_742.wav|The Jarl has finally agreed to send you back to Riverwood.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_743.wav|I don't expect the three of you to fight off a dragon by yourselves. But I do expect you to do your duty.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_744.wav|You little wretch, I saw that!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_745.wav|Some of these Nords will come up with any excuse to despise us.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_746.wav|And it isn't just the dark elves they hate -- they make a target of the Argonians as well.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_747.wav|In fact, just about anyone who isn't a Nord is fair game for their bullying.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_748.wav|Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_749.wav|Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_750.wav|I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_751.wav|You should come, too.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_752.wav|Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_753.wav|Farengar!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_754.wav|Let's go.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_761.wav|What do you need to take?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_762.wav|Fine. What?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_763.wav|Forget it. I don't do that kind of work.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_764.wav|Right, then.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_765.wav|I'm heading home if you need me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_766.wav|What?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_767.wav|Still have something you need?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_768.wav|Let's not waste any time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_769.wav|Looks like you got someone already.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_770.wav|We've stopped. What is it?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_771.wav|I'm still here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_772.wav|Let's get going.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_773.wav|We going?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_774.wav|Still standing here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_775.wav|I'll be right here, then.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_776.wav|Let's go.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_777.wav|Lead on, then.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_778.wav|Following.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_779.wav|No. Not possible.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_780.wav|Your call.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_781.wav|Go on ahead. I'll stand guard.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_782.wav|He was rather straight forward with Torygg.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_783.wav|Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_784.wav|True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_785.wav|Finally.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_786.wav|Prey waits.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_787.wav|"That """"boy"""" was High King of Skyrim."|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_788.wav|Ulfric is the one who has offended. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_789.wav|It's time to decide.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_790.wav|But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_791.wav|Wait for me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_792.wav|Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_793.wav|I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_794.wav|But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_795.wav|I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_796.wav|I understand.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_797.wav|Of course.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_798.wav|How much?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_799.wav|It can't be helped.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_800.wav|Not my problem.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_801.wav|It would seem so.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_802.wav|It's all in this note.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_803.wav|You've done well.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_804.wav|Maybe you can help me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_805.wav|Thank you. Here, this is for you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_806.wav|Just bring it back to me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_807.wav|I can pay you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_808.wav|In a fight, if you see a big wind up, get out of the way or bash him with your shield. Attacks like that go right through a regular block.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_809.wav|When the other guy has his shield up, regular blows are useless. Wind up and hit him with a really powerful attack to get past that shield.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_810.wav|Even if your opponent doesn't have a shield, those big, powerful blows can stagger him. Leaves him open for a quick follow up blow.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_811.wav|Using two weapons means you've got no defense. You can't block anything. But if you hit him with both at the same time, he may not get up again.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_812.wav|Only a fool lets himself get surrounded. Back up and make them come at you one at a time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_813.wav|Those big, powerful blows are tiring. Pace yourself until you've got the stamina to do one.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_814.wav|Any fool can just flail about, swinging his weapon as fast as he can. Any fool can die. Keep your guard up and wait for an opening.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_815.wav|Don't just stand still to do your big wind-up blows. Which way you're moving changes what happens and can be a big advantage.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_816.wav|Ah! It burns!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_817.wav|I'm on fire!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_819.wav|Well then, you're talking to the right person. I'm the only one left in Tamriel that can get my hands on it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_820.wav|It's damn near impossible to find anymore. You want to buy it off of me?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_821.wav|I do. Still want to buy it?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_822.wav|I'm sorry you feel my illegal contraband is overpriced, perhaps you should bring it up at the next merchant guild meeting.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_823.wav|Look, you want it, I got it. You know the price, so talk to me when you want to cough up the gold.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_824.wav|Good. Here, take this key.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_825.wav|The Balmora Blue is locked in a chest under the docks near the Red Wave. Hope you like getting wet.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_826.wav|Sorry, guess it's too rich for your blood. Come back when you find the coin.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_827.wav|I'm afraid not. How else can a poor, overworked sailor like myself expect to earn a living?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_828.wav|Make sure to pull your bow all the way back to get the most power out of your shot.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_829.wav|If you want to sharpen your blade, use the grindstone. Although you'll need the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_830.wav|Want to improve your armor? Use the workbench. Make sure you have the right raw materials, such as iron or steel.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_831.wav|If you want to make new armor or weapons, use the forge. It takes plenty of raw materials though, such as iron or steel.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_832.wav|Before you can enchant your weapon or armor, you'll need to learn an enchantment by sacrificing an enchanted item. Just use the arcane enchanter.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_833.wav|If you know an enchantment and have a filled soul gem, you can enchant armor and weapons. Just use the arcane enchanter.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_834.wav|You can eat an ingredient to learn one of its properties. However, they taste disgusting.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_835.wav|You can make your own potions by mixing up to three ingredients together. Just use the Alchemy Lab.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_837.wav|You've come to the wrong city, then. Windhelm's a haven of prejudice and narrow thinking, unworthy of one such as you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_838.wav|Then we have nothing more to talk about.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_839.wav|Do you hate the dark elves? Are you here to bully us and tell us to leave?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_840.wav|I'm staying out of this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_841.wav|Okay. Just this once.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_842.wav|How can I argue with that?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_843.wav|Okay, okay. You've talked me into it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_844.wav|No need to get rough!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_845.wav|Whatever you say!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_846.wav|Don't hurt me! You win.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_847.wav|A little coin always greases the wheels.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_848.wav|Gold solves most problems, doesn't it?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_849.wav|For that price? Sure.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_850.wav|You expect me to believe that?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_851.wav|Nah. I don't think so.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_852.wav|That doesn't change anything.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_853.wav|I'll teach you to talk to me that way!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_854.wav|Hope you're willing to back those words up with your fists!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_855.wav|I don't have to take that from you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_856.wav|As we walk these stone passages, we delve into the very bones of the earth.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_857.wav|I'm afraid we have little to offer you in the way of hospitality.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_858.wav|I'm a Blade, now. I can hardly believe it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_859.wav|By my honor, I pledge to rid Tamriel of dragons.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_860.wav|Dragonborn. What do you need?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_861.wav|We're with you, Dragonborn.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_862.wav|I do.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_866.wav|Fresh meats and produce! Get them before they're gone!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_867.wav|All meats guaranteed clean and free from Rockjoint!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_868.wav|Vegetables as crisp as a winter's morning!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_869.wav|Well, I'd be careful if I were you. I hear the Nords hunt them for some kind of initiation rite and not all of them end up victorious.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_870.wav|The last traveler that traded me some said he found them at a place called Ancient's Ascent.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_871.wav|Careful though, rumor has it a dragon makes its home there.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_872.wav|Oh! Well if you change your mind, come back and see me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_873.wav|I picked up a trick from a butcher in Elinhir, a small town over the border in Hammerfell.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_889.wav|Get it into the trap before it kills us all!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_890.wav|Let's get this over with.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_891.wav|You're either the bravest person I've ever met, or the biggest fool.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_892.wav|What? Nooo!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_893.wav|We've got an assassin! Check the shadows!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_894.wav|Gods help us!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_895.wav|What in the...?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_896.wav|Did you hear something?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_897.wav|By the gods, did that really just happen?!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_898.wav|Murder! Murder!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_899.wav|Help! Somebody, help!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_900.wav|My blade is yours once more.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_901.wav|Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_902.wav|You've been a worthy patron. Shall I join you once more, free of charge?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_903.wav|My patron appears once more. Have you need of my blade?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_904.wav|It pleases me to see you again, my patron.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_905.wav|I probably shouldn't tell everyone who asks. This is important business, you know.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_906.wav|There's been word of some trouble nearby. I'm on my way to investigate.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_907.wav|Now I have some time to kill...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_908.wav|Just make sure to take care of whatever's going on there. It's my name on the line.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_909.wav|You want to pay me to do my job? Fine. I'll mark the location on your map.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_910.wav|All right, all right! No need to get violent. We're on the same side.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_911.wav|I'll mark it on your map. This one's on you. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_912.wav|Someone's going to get hurt, all right. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_913.wav|If you really want to do my job for me... Here, I'll mark the location on your map.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_914.wav|No, I think I've got this one. Thanks, though. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_915.wav|Thanks for wasting my time. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_927.wav|And where would that be?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_928.wav|I can't believe Miraak made us build those shrines. To take our free will like that... just horrible.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_929.wav|As the wife to the Second Councilor of Raven Rock, it would be my pleasure to help you any way that I can.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_930.wav|Your efforts in Raven Rock have proven most invigorating for my husband. I haven't seen him this pleased in many years.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_931.wav|You aren't here with bad news regarding my husband, are you? I couldn't bear it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_932.wav|It's been a long time since I walked the ashlands of Vvardenfell. I miss it terribly.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_933.wav|Perhaps our town isn't as grand as Mournhold, but it's our home and we must make the most of it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_934.wav|You've brought so much hope to our people, we are forever in your debt.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_935.wav|My husband Vendil feared visitors would shun Raven Rock. I'm glad to see he was mistaken.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_936.wav|Always nice to speak to someone from the mainland.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_937.wav|I hope you enjoy your stay in Raven Rock.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_938.wav|I could never leave Adril behind, and he will never leave Lleril.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_939.wav|Besides, I'd never work for Neloth! I heard he cut the heart out of his former apprentice.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_940.wav|I'm sorry, my love. It's this island... it's never felt the same since we left Vvardenfell. It's as though a part of me is missing.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_941.wav|What's wrong with you? Do you want to ruin everything?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_942.wav|How much longer do you intend to serve as his shield, Adril?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_943.wav|I don't know, look for someone else to hop into bed with perhaps!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_944.wav|If everything goes well, we won't have to stay here much longer. For now, we wait.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_945.wav|I was concerned about our food stores. Gjalund can only carry so much on each journey, and I'm afraid we might run out.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_946.wav|May I have a word with you, Councilor?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_947.wav|I've seen the way you look at her. Do you take me for a fool?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_948.wav|Perhaps that's reassuring enough for you, but it's something that still keeps me awake at night.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_949.wav|It's nothing.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_950.wav|You poor thing. Here you are.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_951.wav|Ask my husband. I'm busy.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_952.wav|Here in his shrine.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_953.wav|That they have forgotten.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_954.wav|Here do we toil.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_955.wav|That we might remember.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_956.wav|By night we reclaim.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_957.wav|What by day was stolen.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_958.wav|Far from ourselves.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_959.wav|He grows ever near to us.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_960.wav|Our eyes once were blinded.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_961.wav|Now through him do we see.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_962.wav|Our hands once were idle.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_963.wav|Now through them does he speak.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_964.wav|And when the world shall listen.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_965.wav|And when the world shall see.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_966.wav|And when the world remembers.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_967.wav|That world will cease to be.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_968.wav|Oh, excuse me! I didn't realize there was anyone else here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_969.wav|Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to meditate a bit.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_970.wav|Oh, no bother. We all have a right to be here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_971.wav|What do you mean? I thought I was clear.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_972.wav|I'm simply honoring a fellow departed Dunmer.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_973.wav|What kind of nonsense is that!?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_974.wav|I'm simply honoring a fellow departed Dunmer, and you hurl baseless accusations at me?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_975.wav|Since there aren't any Ulens left on this island, I've taken it upon myself to leave the traditional offering in their stead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_976.wav|I presume the same thing you're doing... leaving an offering for the departed.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_977.wav|Nice to see a fellow Dunmer following the traditional customs.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_978.wav|I presume the same thing you're doing... leaving an offering for the departed.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_979.wav|Forgive my surprise, it's just that I wouldn't expect that sort of behavior from someone who isn't Dunmer.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_980.wav|So Neloth is afraid to face me himself!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_981.wav|Pawn of Neloth!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_982.wav|Ugh! The heart stone protects me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_983.wav|I assure you, if I could convince Adril to do that, I'd be on the next ship back to Blacklight.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_984.wav|Unfortunately, Adril and Councilor Morvayn are very close friends, and they will never abandon one another... despite my feelings.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_985.wav|He's in grave danger, and yet he continues to place himself in harm's way.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_986.wav|When I fall asleep at night, all I can do is hope he'll still be there when I awaken.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_987.wav|This island was never meant for us. There's too much death here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_988.wav|Adril Arano, Second Councilor of Raven Rock.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_989.wav|How I hate that title... damn fool's going to get himself killed over it someday.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_990.wav|Regardless, I hope to return there someday... which doesn't seem likely given my husband's commitment to Councilor Morvayn.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_991.wav|Hmph. Well, beauty's in the eye of the beholder, I suppose.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_992.wav|I haven't seen the city in over fifty years. Even for a Dunmer, that seems like an eternity.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_993.wav|Adril and I lived in Blacklight, the capital city of Morrowind.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_994.wav|House Redoran has improved Blacklight substantially over the last thousand years... its grandeur rivals that of Mournhold itself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_995.wav|The Rootspire where the Council of Great Houses meet is something to behold.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_996.wav|I'm the wife of a Second Councilor and certain things are expected of me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_997.wav|The most important is that I stand by Adril, no matter how I feel. And I intend to do that until we get off this miserable rock.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_998.wav|Miraak... I'm sure I've heard that name before. Haven't I? Was it in a dream?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_999.wav|Why does that sound so familiar? There's no one here by that name, and yet I swear I've heard it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1000.wav|I just can't be sure. I... I don't think I like talking about this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1001.wav|You're going to pay, outlander.|femaledarkelf

wavs/voiceline_1055.wav|"Yes, the """"Strident Squall"""" or something like that."|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1056.wav|The damn thing sunk right off the coast of Solstheim. Can you imagine?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1057.wav|A few months ago, I had sent an important folio to the First Edition Bookshop in the Imperial City to be rebound.|femaledarkelf

wavs/voiceline_1066.wav|It's a shrine, I think. But I don't remember where it came from.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1067.wav|My husband is second councilor, so I certainly have the means to reward you if you find my folio.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1068.wav|You look able enough to venture outside of town. Perhaps you could help me recover something precious that was lost?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1069.wav|Ugh, I can't believe I was forced to do manual labor at those shrines. It was horrifying...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1070.wav|Mogrul says pay up. We figure we can just take it off your corpse.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1071.wav|If you say so. That old crackpot made the trials sound a lot harder than that.|femaledarkelf
