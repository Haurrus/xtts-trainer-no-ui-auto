wavs/voiceline_167.wav|Do not ask me to take treasures from this place. I will not risk the anger of the dead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_168.wav|The Dwemer who built this place were sometimes called Dwarves, but history records that they were no shorter than humans.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_169.wav|There are scholars in Cyrodiil who have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of the Dwemers' disappearance.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_170.wav|It is remarkable that so many of these ancient Dwemer creations still function.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_171.wav|There are those who believe that the entire Dwemer race will one day return just as suddenly as it vanished.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_172.wav|So many shadowy corners to strike from! I could learn to like this place.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_173.wav|Silence will serve us well in this place. Let us take our foes by surprise.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_174.wav|Be wary for traps. If you spy one, try to get an enemy to trigger it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_175.wav|I can see the battle-lust in your eyes. Doom will surely come to any who cross your path.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_176.wav|You're not supposed to be here...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_177.wav|I like to bring Grimvar down here sometimes. It reminds him how lucky he is.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_178.wav|When Grimvar asks me why women are being killed around the city. I don't even know what to say to him.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_179.wav|Ever tried taking care of children? It can be a nightmare.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_180.wav|Looking for shipping? We'll always offer better service than the East Empire Company.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_181.wav|These lazy Argonians better get their tails moving.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_182.wav|You hear about the Shatter-shield girl? It's a tragedy.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_183.wav|Torbjorn wants the shipping operations to bring in cash, and I make it happen.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_190.wav|Stay away from my family if you value your life.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_191.wav|You! Fetcher! I should kill you for assaulting my family. But I will accept your apology...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_405.wav|I know you can hear me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_406.wav|Die, you Orc filth!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_407.wav|You'll make a fine rug, cat!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_409.wav|Careful not to torch anything important.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_410.wav|What do you think you're doing?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_411.wav|In dark times friends bring light. This is for you. Thank you for your friendship.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_412.wav|Sorry, Tythis. I'll get it to you somehow.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_413.wav|Just give me a few more days and I promise I'll come up with it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_414.wav|You must be starving. Here, spend it well.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_415.wav|Oh if only I could provide more than this coin. I hope it'll do.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_416.wav|Good. Take this token of my gratitude.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_417.wav|The deed is done. We need speak of it no longer.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_418.wav|You speak the truth.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_419.wav|I do. Now and forever.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_420.wav|It is a lonely thing, facing all the dangers of Skyrim by yourself. Come and find me if you decide that you miss my companionship.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_421.wav|If that is what you wish.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_422.wav|I am the shadow at your back.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_423.wav|As you wish.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_424.wav|It's time to leave.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_425.wav|I assume everyone's gone ahead of us as planned. I just swept through the castle, no one's here. |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_426.wav|Now. We really must be going, sir.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_427.wav|As soon as we can muster our forces, we'll be back.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_428.wav|That's the battle you need to fight. Not this. This will be suicide. And to what end?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_429.wav|Take a look.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_535.wav|Ah, fire. A capricious element. Often deadly, but always exciting.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_536.wav|That's a decent enchantment. But keep studying, you've only scratched the surface.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_537.wav|It's wise to carry a few summoning enchantments around.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_538.wav|It's intriguing the way certain materials are more or less receptive to the force of lightning, is it not?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_539.wav|Well done. Not many enchanters could pull that off.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_540.wav|Panic we can handle, Balgruuf. It's the dragons I'm not so sure about.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_541.wav|I've dispatched a rider to Helgen. We'll know soon enough.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_542.wav|Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_543.wav|Let's go. We need to get to the Western Watchtower before it's too late.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_544.wav|I'll see you at the watchtower as soon as the rest of the men have gathered.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_545.wav|Follow me. We're assembling near the main gate.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_546.wav|No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_547.wav|Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_548.wav|Damned good shooting, boys!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_549.wav|Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_550.wav|Everybody get back!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_551.wav|Let's move out.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_552.wav|Be careful. We need to find out what happened here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_553.wav|We could always use help picking crops if you need a few extra coins.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_554.wav|Honest pay for honest work.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_555.wav|Honest pay for honest work.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_556.wav|I've seen enough. Put on some clothes.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_557.wav|Keep your damn spells to yourself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_558.wav|Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_559.wav|Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_560.wav|Everything I've got on display, really.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_561.wav|See for yourself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_562.wav|So, you wish to master the arcane arts...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_563.wav|Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you'll appreciate this...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_564.wav|Yes, sera?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_565.wav|And what might you need? Hmm?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_566.wav|Go, you're not wanted here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_567.wav|I'm getting out of here!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_568.wav|What the?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_570.wav|Another corpse for the pile.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_571.wav|Safe travels.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_572.wav|Wait, what are you doing?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_573.wav|You turned me invisible!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_574.wav|I hope you're not expecting a thank you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_575.wav|Excellent. I think you'll be glad that you made this decision.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_576.wav|If you change your mind, you know where to find me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_577.wav|Thank you. I'll be sure to put it to good use.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_578.wav|That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_579.wav|Oh no! By the gods! This can't be happening!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_580.wav|Not now.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_581.wav|Suddenly I feel like I can take on the world.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_582.wav|Azura bless you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_583.wav|Ha, what a coward. Didn't even put up a proper fight.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_584.wav|No, I guess not. Well, get out of here before I change my mind.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_585.wav|Yes, actually. You look like you're lousy with gold.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_586.wav|All right, hand over your valuables, or I'll gut you like a fish.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_587.wav|Hail, brother! I saw you walking there and thought you might need this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_588.wav|Hail, sister! I saw you walking there and thought you could use this.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_589.wav|Hail, Nightingale! Luck has shined down on me and made me a rich man. Here is your cut, as promised.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_590.wav|A Nightingale? Oh, I had no idea. My apologies.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_591.wav|Good luck out there!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_592.wav|Well. I, uh, can see you're not one to be trifled with. Let this be a warning to you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_593.wav|Nice try, but you don't scare me.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_594.wav|Of course! I've seen you at the Flagon. My mistake.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_595.wav|Then I guess that's your last request, fool!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_596.wav|I'm not going to ask again.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_597.wav|Put that down.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_598.wav|Careful with that.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_599.wav|Don't you walk away from me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_600.wav|Time to die, hero!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_601.wav|Go ahead, try and fight back!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_602.wav|Behold my power!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_603.wav|The elements are mine to command!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_604.wav|You remind me of my cousin's cat. Killed that, too!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_606.wav|Die, N'wah!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_607.wav|Die, dragon!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_608.wav|You can't win this!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_615.wav|That's close enough.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_616.wav|I'm warning you. Back off!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_617.wav|Looks like you've got some help already. I'll join you, but you'll have to let your comrade go. What do you say?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_618.wav|Blade and shadow, silence and death - these are my arts. For a modest fee, I'll make great art for you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_619.wav|I understand. Speaking to a goddess is overwhelming for many. Return when you're prepared.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_620.wav|This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_621.wav|She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_622.wav|Keep firing!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_623.wav|That's it! We'll bring that bastard down!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_624.wav|Is that all you've got?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_625.wav|For Whiterun and Skyrim!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_626.wav|Come down here and fight, you coward!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_627.wav|If you change your mind, seek me out here.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_628.wav|There's nothing more I can teach you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_629.wav|You've already learned all I can teach you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_630.wav|You already know all that I know.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_631.wav|Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_632.wav|I know nothing of fear, and nothing of remorse. Pay my fee, and together we will vanquish any foe.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_633.wav|I am a lethal instrument, yours to command for a modest sum. I suggest you hire me before one of your enemies does.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_634.wav|These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_635.wav|Balgruuf, did you slip out again last night for a drink at the Bannered Mare?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_636.wav|And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_637.wav|I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_638.wav|That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_639.wav|I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_640.wav|I'm not sticking around to fight a dragon!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_641.wav|They live below the streets in the Ratway like dirty animals. And trust me, they're no better than the vermin that slink out of there for scraps.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_642.wav|They make it difficult for decent people to earn a living. Of course, not many decent people live here in the first place.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_643.wav|It's Riften's name for the sewers beneath our feet. Absolutely disgusting!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_644.wav|If you fancy keeping your purse filled with gold and your head on your shoulders, I'd stay out of those awful tunnels.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_645.wav|If you're planning violence against me or mine, you'll regret it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_646.wav|Die, vampire!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_647.wav|Can I help you?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_755.wav|The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_756.wav|Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_757.wav|But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_758.wav|Lead the way.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_759.wav|Will do.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_760.wav|That it?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_874.wav|He showed me a way to grind up ice wraith teeth and use it as a preservative. Keeps everything cold and fresh, but only for a limited time.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_875.wav|I'm always looking to replenish my supply, so if you ever come across five of them, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_876.wav|Thanks again for the ice wraith teeth.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_877.wav|Be careful looking for those teeth... those little bastards are dangerous.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_878.wav|Keep your belly full and your shoulders strong.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_879.wav|Perfect, just perfect! These should help keep my stock fresh for quite a while.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_880.wav|And, as promised, here's my trade. Hope you like it.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_881.wav|Thanks, I was actually worried I'd run out.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_882.wav|My food is the best in all of Skyrim; always as fresh as the day it was collected.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_883.wav|The only way to find fresher meats is to hunt it yourself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_884.wav|Some fresh meat to fill your belly perhaps?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_885.wav|I run the meat and produce stand at the market. Come by and see me if you want some of the freshest food you've ever eaten.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_886.wav|I'll be glad when this beast is gone from here. Do whatever it is you need to do with it, Dragonborn.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_887.wav|Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_888.wav|By all the gods...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1022.wav|...just one more bottle... maybe a second one to get to sleep...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1023.wav|...she was real surprised when I pulled that knife from my boot...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1024.wav|...captain promised me a life o' adventure on the high seas...instead I'm stuck on this cesspit of an island...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1025.wav|...damn wizards... not good enough for yer precious college, eh? |femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1026.wav|...I'd kill for a decent bottle of mead... not fair that they always take the good stuff...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1027.wav|...I should go back to pickin' pockets in Windhelm... easy money, less chance of an axe in your skull...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1028.wav|...knew a girl with hair of gold, I called her fair, she called me bold...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1029.wav|...ale and mead, ale and mead, 'tis the only advice a sailor heeds...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1030.wav|I... I don't know. It almost feels like a dream. Something about a temple on the island...|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1031.wav|The Master calls.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1032.wav|The idle mind sleeps.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1033.wav|I am his hands.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1034.wav|He draws near.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1035.wav|Here we reclaim.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1036.wav|What faithless minds have stolen.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1037.wav|What happened?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1038.wav|I feel, different somehow. More myself.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1039.wav|Please, I don't wish to be disturbed while I'm meditating.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1040.wav|For House Hlaalu!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1041.wav|Morvayn will pay for this!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1042.wav|Years of planning, ruined!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1043.wav|I'll spill your blood, fetcher!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1044.wav|Die, Redoran lackey!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1045.wav|You've gone far enough. Neloth is a fool to think he could send some low life to finish me off.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1046.wav|You have?|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1047.wav|You have no idea what this means to me... to my family. Reclamations bless you!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1048.wav|Well, you've certainly proven your worth around here to me. Please, accept this gift as a token of my appreciation!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1049.wav|Mephala bless you! You found it!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1050.wav|Well, you've certainly proven your worth around here to me. Please, accept this gift as a token of my appreciation!|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1051.wav|Offer to help and then change your mind because I mentioned the reavers? Hmph, some sellsword you are.|femaledarkelf
wavs/voiceline_1052.wav|Thank you, you have no idea how much it hurts losing such a precious heirloom!|femaledarkelf
